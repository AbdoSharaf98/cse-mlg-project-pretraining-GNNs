# Code for CSE 8803 (ML with Graphs) project: Pretraining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with similarity matching and locality sensitive hashing

This repository contains the code for a GNN pretraining approach I developed for the CSE 8803 (MLG) course at Georgia Tech. The approach relies on a similarity matching objective used to train a GNN for an initial embedding stage, followed by [a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aam9868) developed by Dasgupta et. al (2017).
